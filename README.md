## Python and SQLAlchemy 
### By Rodrigo guarneros

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.

This time we built an API so as to get response in a public database. This application is developed in python and look like this:

The endpoints or routes available get the information in json format, so as to facilitate the use of information:

Behind this API there are several important components such as: 

- Python SQLAlchemy toolkit
- Object Relational Mapper
- Engine, Database and Session

Just after this point, you can find an statisc data analysis, with the following outcomes:

- Precipitation evolution per day:

- Distribution of observed temperature in selected mesurement stations:

- Measurements by station

- Temperature measures in an specific point of time
